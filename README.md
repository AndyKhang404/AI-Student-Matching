# AI Student Matching System

An intelligent study partner recommendation system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to connect students based on their subjects, availability, and personal interests.

## Features
- **Hard Constraints Filtering:** Matches users based on shared subjects and overlapping free time.
- **AI-Powered Similarity:** Uses `Sentence-Transformers` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to calculate personality and hobby compatibility.
- **Interactive UI:** A clean, user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Optimized Matching:** Utilizes Cosine Similarity and KNN for efficient results.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **AI/ML:** Sentence-Transformers, Scikit-learn
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Interface:** Streamlit

## Installation & Setup
